## Labs

### Reverse Shell Activity
- **Objective:** establish a callback from target to listener and validate control flow.
- **Skills:** listener setup, payload execution, process and network tracing, log review, basic containment.
- **Artifacts:** scripts or snippets, screenshots, notes.

### SQL Injection Activity
- **Objective:** identify and exploit input handling flaws that alter SQL query logic.
- **Skills:** finding injectable inputs, confirming impact, safe test design, remediation patterns.
- **Artifacts:** lab notes and `SQL Injection Activity Process.pdf`, sample payloads, screenshots.


## Ethics and scope

Educational use only. Test only systems you own or have explicit written permission to assess. Keep all activity sandboxed and do not run payloads on production networks.
