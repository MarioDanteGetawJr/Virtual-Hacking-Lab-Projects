# Welcome to my Reverse Shell Activity!

This was a project completed during cybersecurity courses at Wittenberg University.
Using python, I wrote a reverse shell client, in which itâ€™s purpose is to be installed 
on the machine I am attacking and it will initiate a connection from within the network 
to the attackers computer that is outside of the network. This gets around a firewall 
and NAT from a companies network. Next, I wrote a bind shell, which allows me to execute 
commands remotely from my computer to the compromised machine. In my case, I am attacking 
a vulnerable Metasploitable virtual machine from my kali linux virtual machine.

In the main branch, I have included all the python code, and a file that documents the process 
and result of my project
