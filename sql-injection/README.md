# Welcome to My SQL Injection Activity!

This was a project completed during cybersecurity courses at Wittenberg University.
In this activity I am utilizing SQLmap in Kali Linux to perform a SQL injection on a well-known web
application, OWASP Mutillidae. SQLmap is a tool that automates the process of exploiting sql vulnerabilities. 
In this case, I am attacking OWASP Mutillidae, a well-known web application that is deliberately configured for 
ethical hackers topractice on.
